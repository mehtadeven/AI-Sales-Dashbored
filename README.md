## Description

The Dynamic AI Sales Dashboard is a powerful web application designed to help businesses visualize, analyze, and gain actionable insights from their sales data. It allows users to easily upload sales data files (CSV or XLSX), view key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze sales trends and profitability, and receive intelligent, AI-powered sales suggestions to drive growth.

This project features a clear separation of concerns with a Python Flask backend for data processing and an interactive HTML/JavaScript frontend for data visualization.

## Features

* **File Uploads:** Easily upload sales data in `.csv` or `.xlsx` formats.
* **Dynamic Data Loading:** Select from previously uploaded files to view their data.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * Total Revenue
    * Total Profit
    * Average Profit Margin
    * Month-over-Month (MoM) Revenue Growth
* **Interactive Charts (powered by Chart.js):**
    * Sales by Category (Doughnut Chart)
    * Sales Trend over Time (Line Chart)
    * Most Profitable Products (Bar Chart)
* **Profitability Analysis:** Identify both your most and least profitable products.
* **AI-Powered Sales Suggestions:** Get concise, actionable insights generated by the Gemini API to improve sales and profitability.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.
* **Interactive Background:** A subtle, dynamic particle background for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
* **HTML5:** Structure of the web pages.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling and responsive design.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Client-side logic and interactivity.
* **Chart.js:** Flexible JavaScript charting library for data visualization.

### Backend
* **Python 3.x:** Core programming language.
* **Flask:** Lightweight Python web framework for building the API.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library for handling CSV/XLSX files.
* **Flask-CORS:** Extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
* **Requests:** HTTP library for making API calls to the Gemini API.
* **Werkzeug:** WSGI utility library used by Flask for secure filename handling.
* **Gemini API:** Google's AI model for generating sales suggestions.

## How to Access and Run the Project

To run this project locally, you need to set up both the backend (Flask server) and the frontend (HTML/JavaScript).

### Prerequisites:

1.  **Python 3.x:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  **`pip`:** Python's package installer, usually comes with Python.
3.  **Required Python Libraries:** You'll need `Flask`, `pandas`, `flask-cors`, `requests`, `numpy`, and `werkzeug`.

### Steps to Run:

1.  **Save the Files:**

    * Save the `app.py` file in a directory (e.g., `my_sales_app/backend/app.py`).
    * Save the `index.html` file in a subdirectory named `frontend` relative to your `app.py` (e.g., `my_sales_app/frontend/index.html`).
    * Create an empty directory named `sales_uploads` inside the `backend` directory (e.g., `my_sales_app/backend/sales_uploads`).

    Your directory structure should look like this:

    ```
    my_sales_app/
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── app.py
    │   └── sales_uploads/  (empty directory for uploads)
    └── frontend/
        └── index.html
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the `backend` directory (`cd my_sales_app/backend`), and install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install Flask pandas Flask-CORS requests numpy werkzeug
    ```

3.  **Set Your Gemini API Key (Optional but Recommended for AI Suggestions):**
    The `app.py` code tries to get the API key from an environment variable named `API_KEY`. For the AI suggestions feature to work, you should set this environment variable. Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual key.

    * **On Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```

    * **On Windows (Command Prompt)::**

        ```cmd
        set API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```

    * **On Windows (PowerShell):**

        ```powershell
        $env:API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```

    * **Note:** This sets the environment variable for the current terminal session. If you close the terminal, you'll need to set it again. For persistent setup, you might add it to your shell's profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `config.fish`).

4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory in your terminal, run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5000/`.

5.  **Access the Frontend:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the Flask server, which is usually:

    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

    or

    ```
    http://localhost:5000/
    ```

    You should now see the "Welcome to your Sales Dashboard" message. You can then use the "Upload New File" button to upload your sales data (CSV or XLSX) and start exploring the dashboard.

This setup will allow you to run and interact with your Dynamic AI Sales Dashboard locally.

## Acknowledgements

* Thanks to Flask for providing a robust web framework.
* Thanks to Pandas for powerful data manipulation capabilities.
* Thanks to Chart.js for excellent charting solutions.
* Thanks to Tailwind CSS for simplifying styling.
* Thanks to Google's Gemini API for AI-powered insights.

## Troubleshooting

* **"Connection Error" on Dashboard:**
    * Ensure your Flask backend (`app.py`) is running in your terminal.
    * Check if the `API_URL` in `index.html` matches the port your Flask app is running on (default is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api`).
    * Verify that `Flask-CORS` is correctly installed and enabled in `app.py`.
* **AI Suggestions Not Working:**
    * Confirm that you have set the `API_KEY` environment variable with a valid Gemini API key.
    * Check your `app.py` terminal for any errors related to the Gemini API request.
    * Ensure your uploaded sales file contains a 'cost' column, as it's required for profit calculations and AI suggestions.
